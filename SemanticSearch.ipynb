    "## Semantic Embedding and Search on Hospitality KPI Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to transform structured hospitality KPI data into natural language sentences and generate vector embeddings using the `sentence-transformers` library. These embeddings enable semantic similarity search, allowing us to query the dataset using human-like questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Which dates had low occupancy but high ADR?\"  \n",
    "> \"Find months with performance similar to March 2023\"  \n",
    "> \"Show periods with peak RevPAR during shoulder season\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I have created mock data for three years, containing daily values for:\n",
    "- Occupancy\n",
    "- Average Daily Rate (ADR)\n",
    "- Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\n",
    "- Demand and Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "The core goals of this notebook are:\n",
    "1. Convert KPI rows into descriptive sentences\n",
    "2. Generate semantic embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model\n",
    "3. Perform similarity search based on user queries\n",
    "\n",
    "This project forms the foundation for a hospitality-focused vector search system, useful in AI-driven reporting, forecasting, or benchmarking applications.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this project, I transformed structured hospitality KPI data into descriptive text and generated semantic embeddings using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model. By applying cosine similarity between vectors, I built a semantic search system that allows users to query hotel performance data using natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this system, I can answer questions like *\"Which dates had low occupancy but high ADR?\"* or *\"Show dates with high RevPAR\"* — retrieving results based on semantic meaning rather than simple keyword matches.\n",

    "This project demonstrates my ability to apply modern NLP techniques and vector-based search to real-world business data.\n"
